      "text": "Last year, there was a boy named Leo. He was a good student, and he had many friends at school. He always liked to read, and he often told his friends: “I want to make my own story one day.”\n\nOne day, he said to his best friend: “This is the time to do something new. I will write a story.” His friend answered: “Great! You can do it. I know you will make it good.”\n\nLeo started to think. He thought about what kind of story he could tell. He looked at the things around him, and he remembered how his father told him stories in the past. That memory gave him an idea.\n\nAt home, Leo wrote about a hero. The hero was strong, but also kind. He helped people, and he never said “no” when someone needed him. The hero always found a way to come home and spend time with his family.\n\nThe next morning, Leo went to school. He told his teacher: “I made a story. Do you want me to read it?” The teacher said: “Yes, please. That will be great.”\n\nSo Leo read the story to the class. His friends listened, and they liked it a lot. They said: “It is good! We also want to make stories like this one.” His teacher said: “This is just the beginning. You will write more, and each one will be better.”\n\nLeo felt very happy. He knew that in the past he only dreamed, but now he was doing it. And in the future, he will write many more stories. He will tell people about heroes, about time, about big and small things, and about the way life can be.\n\nLeo said to himself: “I will not stop. I want to write, I will write, and I know my stories will make people think and smile.”\n\nAnd from that day, Leo became not just a boy, but a writer.",
